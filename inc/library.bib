@article{Neal2003,
	Abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can ample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

	Abstract = {Most living organisms use pheromones for inter-individual communication. In Drosophila melanogaster flies, several pheromones perceived either by contact/at a short distance (cuticular hydrocarbons, CHs), or at a longer distance (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cVA), affect courtship and mating behaviours. However, it has not previously been possible to precisely identify all potential pheromonal compounds and simultaneously monitor their variation on a time scale. To overcome this limitation, we combined Solid Phase Micro-Extraction with gas-chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry. This allowed us (i) to identify 59 cuticular compounds, including 17 new CHs; (ii) to precisely quantify the amount of each compound that could be detected by another fly, and (iii) to measure the variation of these substances as a function of aging and mating. Sex-specific variation appeared with age, while mating affected cuticular compounds in both sexes with three possible patterns: variation was (i) reciprocal in the two sexes, suggesting a passive mechanical transfer during mating, (ii) parallel in both sexes, such as for cVA which strikingly appeared during mating, or (iii) unilateral, presumably as a result of sexual interaction. We provide a complete reassessment of all Drosophila CHs and suggest that the chemical conversation between male and female flies is far more complex than is generally accepted. We conclude that focusing on individual compounds will not provide a satisfactory understanding of the evolution and function of chemical communication in Drosophila.},

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In animals, a crucial facet of any gene's function is the tissue or cell type in which that gene is expressed and the proteins that it interacts with in that cell. However, genome-wide identification of expression across the multitude of tissues of varying size and complexity is difficult to achieve experimentally. In this paper, we show that microararray data collected from whole animals can be analyzed to yield high-quality predictions of tissue-specific expression. These predictions are of better or comparable accuracy to tissue-specific expression determined from high-throughput experiments. Our results provide a global view of tissue-specific expression in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, allowing us to address the question of how expression patterns are regulated and to analyze how the functions of genes that are expressed in several tissues are influenced by the cellular context.</p>

	Abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarray experiments generating thousands of gene expression measurements, are being used to gather information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences that will be useful in diagnosing disease. We have developed a new method to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines (SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissue samples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled or questionable tissue results.Results: We demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment results for 97802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled. Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier, perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed. The results are comparable to those previously obtained. We show that other machine learning methods also perform comparably to the SVM on many of those datasets.Availability: The SVM software is available at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/\~{}bgrundy/svm.Contact: booch@cse.ucsc.edu},

We demonstrate some limitations of the original HDP-HMM formulation (Teh et al., 2006), and propose a sticky exten- sion which allows more robust learning of smoothly varying dynamics. Using DP mix- tures, this formulation also allows learning of more complex, multimodal emission dis- tributions. We further develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approx- imation of the DP to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Via extensive experiments with syn- thetic data and the NIST speaker diarization database, we demonstrate the advantages of our sticky extension, and the utility of the HDP-HMM in real-world applications.},

First, the FB variables are redefined in terms of posterior probabilities to avoid possible underflows that may occur in practice. Then, a forward recursion is used that is symmetric to the backward one and can reduce the number of logic gates required to implement on a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) chip.},

	Abstract = {Summary: vbmp is an R package for Gaussian Process classification of data over multiple classes. It features multinomial probit regression with Gaussian Process priors and estimates class posterior probabilities employing fast variational approximations to the full posterior. This software also incorporates feature weighting by means of Automatic Relevance Determination. Being equipped with only one main function and reasonable default values for optional parameters, vbmp combines flexibility with ease of usage as is demonstrated on a breast cancer microarray study. Availability: The R library vbmp implementing this method is part of Bioconductor and can be downloaded from http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/\~{}girolami Contact: nicola.lama\{$\backslash$char64\}unina2.it Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/\~{}girolami },

	Abstract = {The study of developmental patterning has been facilitated by the availability of mutations that produce changes in cell fate, in animals such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We now describe a zygotic lethal mutation in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio, that also changes how particular embryonic cells develop. Severe pattern deficiencies are observed that are restricted to a single body region, the trunk. The mutation may directly affect mesoderm, as somites do not form in the trunk. Head and tail structures, including tail somites, are relatively undisturbed. The earliest detected expression of the mutation is during gastrulation, when movements of mesodermal cells occur incorrectly. We injected prospective trunk mesodermal cells with lineage tracer dye and observed that in mutants these cells may enter a new body region, the tail, and there may express a new fate appropriate for the changed position.},

	Abstract = {It is not a coincidence that DNA barcoding has developed in concert with genomics-based investigations. DNA barcoding (a tool for rapid species identification based on DNA sequences) and genomics (which compares entire genome structure and expression) share an emphasis on largescale genetic data acquisition that offers new answers to questions previously beyond the reach of traditional disciplines. DNA barcodes consist of a standardized short sequence of DNA (400800 bp) that in principle should be easily generated and characterized for all species on the planet (1). A massive on-line digital library of barcodes will serve as a standard to which the DNA barcode sequence of an unidentified sample from the forest, garden, or market can be matched. Similar to genomics, which has accelerated the process of recognizing novel genes and comparing gene function, DNA barcoding will allow users to efficiently recognize known species and speed the discovery of species yet to be found in nature. DNA barcoding aims to use the information of one or a few gene regions to identify all species of life, whereas genomics, the inverse of barcoding, describes in one (e.g., humans) or a few selected species the function and interactions across all genes.},

	Abstract = {Compositional asymmetries are pervasive in DNA sequences. They are the result of the asymmetric interactions between DNA and cellular mechanisms such as replication and transcription. Here, we review many of the methods that have been proposed over the years to analyse compositional asymmetries in DNA sequences. Among these we list GC skews, oligonucleotide skews and wavelets, which among other uses have been extensively employed to delimitate origins and termini of replication in genomes. We also review the use of multivariate methods, such as factorial correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis and analysis of variance, which allow assigning compositional strand asymmetries to the different biological processes shaping sequence composition. Finally, we review methods that have been used to infer substitution matrices and allow understanding the mutational processes underlying strand asymmetry. We focus on replication asymmetries because they have been more thoroughly studied, but the methods may be adapted, and often are, to other problems. Although strand asymmetry has been studied more frequently through compositional skews of nucleotides or oligonucleotides, we recall that, depending on the goal of the analysis, other methods may be more appropriate to answer certain biological questions. We also refer to programs freely available to analyse strand asymmetry.},

Unbiased pyrosequencing of RNA extracts from serum and tissues of outbreak victims enabled identification and detailed phylogenetic characterization within 72 hours of sample receipt. Full genome analyses of LUJV showed it to be unique and branching off the ancestral node of the Old World arenaviruses. The virus G1 glycoprotein sequence was highly diverse and almost equidistant from that of other Old World and New World arenaviruses, consistent with a potential distinctive receptor tropism. LUJV is a novel, genetically distinct, highly pathogenic arenavirus.},

Standard classification and regression models are not suited to multiple labels and typically a pre-processing step (normally assigning the majority class) is performed. We propose Bayesian models for classification and ordinal regression that naturally incorporate multiple expert opinions in defining predictive distributions. The models make use of Gaussian process priors, resulting in great flexibility and particular suitability to text based problems where the number of covariates can be far greater than the number of data instances. We show that using all labels rather than just the majority improves performance on a recent biological dataset. },

We give a unified overview of models previously introduced in the literature, which is simpler and more comprehensive than previous descriptions and enables us to highlight commonalities and differences among models that were not observed in the past. In addition, we present several new models and inference routines, which are naturally derived within this unified viewpoint.},

By using the theory of Dirichlet processes we can implicitly integrate out the infinitely many transition parameters, leaving only three hyperparameters which can be learned from data. These three hyperparameters define a hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing a rich set of transition dynamics. The three hyperparameters control the time scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix, and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a finite sequence. In this framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be infinite--consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in English text.},

	Abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@book{Bishop2006,
	Abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

@article{Seberg2009,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA barcoding promises to revolutionize the way taxonomists work, facilitating species identification by using small, standardized portions of the genome as substitutes for morphology. The concept has gained considerable momentum in many animal groups, but the higher plant world has been largely recalcitrant to the effort. In plants, efforts are concentrated on various regions of the plastid genome, but no agreement exists as to what kinds of regions are ideal, though most researchers agree that more than one region is necessary. One reason for this discrepancy is differences in the tests that are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed regions. Most tests have been made in a floristic setting, where the genetic distance and therefore the level of variation of the regions between taxa is large, or in a limited set of congeneric species. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present the first in-depth coverage of a large taxonomic group, all 86 known species (except two doubtful ones) of crocus. Even six average-sized barcode regions do not identify all crocus species. This is currently an unrealistic burden in a barcode context. Whereas most proposed regions work well in a floristic context, the majority will--as is the case in crocus--undoubtedly be less efficient in a taxonomic setting. However, a reasonable but less than perfect level of identification may be reached--even in a taxonomic context. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The time is ripe for selecting barcode regions in plants, and for prudent examination of their utility. Thus, there is no reason for the plant community to hold back the barcoding effort by continued search for the Holy Grail. We must acknowledge that an emerging system will be far from perfect, fraught with problems and work best in a floristic setting.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: There are several levels of uncertainty involved in the mathematical modelling of biochemical systems. There often may be a degree of uncertainty about the values of kinetic parameters, about the general structure of the model and about the behaviour of biochemical species which cannot be observed directly. The methods of Bayesian inference provide a consistent framework for modelling and predicting in these uncertain conditions. We present a software package for applying the Bayesian inferential methodology to problems in systems biology. Results: Described herein is a software package, BioBayes, which provides a framework for Bayesian parameter estimation and evidential model ranking over models of biochemical systems defined using ordinary differential equations. The package is extensible allowing additional modules to be included by developers. There are no other such packages available which provide this functionality.

	Abstract = {Plasmid vectors containing Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes were constructed that expressed prM and E proteins under the control of a cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter. COS-1 cells transformed with this plasmid vector (JE-4B clone) secreted JEV-specific extracellular particles (EPs) into the culture media. Groups of outbred ICR mice were given one or two doses of recombinant plasmid DNA or two doses of the commercial vaccine JEVAX. All mice that received one or two doses of DNA vaccine maintained JEV-specific antibodies 18 months after initial immunization. JEVAX induced 100\% seroconversion in 3-week-old mice; however, none of the 3-day-old mice had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers higher than 1:400. Female mice immunized with this DNA vaccine developed plaque reduction neutralization antibody titers of between 1:20 and 1:160 and provided 45 to 100\% passive protection to their progeny following intraperitoneal challenge with 5,000 PFU of virulent JEV strain SA14. Seven-week-old adult mice that had received a single dose of JEV DNA vaccine when 3 days of age were completely protected from a 50,000-PFU JEV intraperitoneal challenge. These results demonstrate that a recombinant plasmid DNA which produced JEV EPs in vitro is an effective vaccine.},

@article{Tsirigos2005a,
	Abstract = {In earlier work, we introduced and discussed a generalized computational framework for identifying horizontal transfers. This framework relied on a gene's nucleotide composition, obviated the need for knowledge of codon boundaries and database searches, and was shown to perform very well across a wide range of archaeal and bacterial genomes when compared with previously published approaches, such as Codon Adaptation Index and C + G content. Nonetheless, two considerations remained outstanding: we wanted to further increase the sensitivity of detecting horizontal transfers and also to be able to apply the method to increasingly smaller genomes. In the discussion that follows, we present such a method, Wn-SVM, and show that it exhibits a very significant improvement in sensitivity compared with earlier approaches. Wn-SVM uses a one-class support-vector machine and can learn using rather small training sets. This property makes Wn-SVM particularly suitable for studying small-size genomes, similar to those of viruses, as well as the typically larger archaeal and bacterial genomes. We show experimentally that the new method results in a superior performance across a wide range of organisms and that it improves even upon our own earlier method by an average of 10\% across all examined genomes. As a small-genome case study, we analyze the genome of the human cytomegalovirus and demonstrate that Wn-SVM correctly identifies regions that are known to be conserved and prototypical of all beta-herpesvirinae, regions that are known to have been acquired horizontally from the human host and, finally, regions that had not up to now been suspected to be horizontally transferred. Atypical region predictions for many eukaryotic viruses, including the alpha-, beta- and gamma-herpesvirinae, and 123 archaeal and bacterial genomes, have been made available online at http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/HGT\_SVM/.},

Mathematical models are obtained by support vector machine (SVM), back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) and multiple linear regression (MLR). Leave-one-out, Leave-many-out (7\% and 18\%) cross-validation and external validation are carried out with the aim of evaluating the predictive ability of the models. The values of their respective squared correlations coefficients are 0.731, 0.664, 0.523 and 0.766, respectively. Our best QSAR model reveals the polarizability, mass as the most influencing atomic properties in the structures of the carboxylic acid derivatives.},

	Abstract = {Yellow fever is among one of the most lethal viral diseases for which approved antiviral therapies were yet to be discovered. Herein, functional assignment of complete YFV proteome was done through support vector machine. Major envelope (E) protein that mediates entry of YFV into host cell was selected as a potent molecular target. Three dimensional structure of the molecular target was predicted using Modeller9v7. The model was optimized in Maestro9.0 applying OPLS AA force field and was evaluated using PROCHECK, ProSA, ProQ and Profile 3D. The BOG pocket residues Val48, Glu197, Thr200, Ile204, Thr265, Thr268 and Gly278 were located in YFV E protein using SiteMap2.3. More than one million compounds of Ligandinfo Meta database were explored using a computational virtual screening protocol targeting BOG pocket of the E protein. Finally, ten top ranked lead molecules with strong binding affinity to BOG pocket of YFV E protein were identified based on XP Gscore. Drug likeliness and comparative bioactivity analysis for these leads using QikProp3.2 had shown that these molecules would have the potential to act as better drug. Thus, the 10 lead molecules suggested in the present study would be of interest as promising starting point for designing antiviral compound against yellow fever.},

	Abstract = {The homeostatic framework has dominated our understanding of cellular physiology. We question whether homeostasis alone adequately explains microbial responses to environmental stimuli, and explore the capacity of intracellular networks for predictive behavior in a fashion similar to metazoan nervous systems. We show that in silico biochemical networks, evolving randomly under precisely defined complex habitats, capture the dynamical, multidimensional structure of diverse environments by forming internal representations that allow prediction of environmental change. We provide evidence for such anticipatory behavior by revealing striking correlations of Escherichia coli transcriptional responses to temperature and oxygen perturbations-precisely mirroring the covariation of these parameters upon transitions between the outside world and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. We further show that these internal correlations reflect a true associative learning paradigm, because they show rapid decoupling upon exposure to novel environments.},

We discuss the use of the l1 norm in the Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) regression model and the Support Vector Machine model. When tested by cross-validation with laboratory measurements, these models predict viral phenotype, or resistance, in response to Reverse-Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTIs) more accurately than other known models. The l1 norm is the most selective convex function, which sets a large proportion of the parameters to zero and also assures that a single optimal solution will be found, given a particular model formulation and training data set. A statistical model that reliably predicts viral drug response is an important tool in the selection of Anti-Retroviral Therapy. These techniques have general application to modeling phenotype from complex genetic data.},

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to select the training set. A variable selection method utilizing a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to select from the large pool of calculated descriptors, an optimal subset of descriptors which have significant contribution to the overall inhibitory activity. The models were validated using Leave-One-Out (LOO) and Leave-Group-Out (LGO) crossvalidation, and Y-randomization test. Results demonstrated the SVM model offers powerful prediction capabilities.},

	Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus (Flaviviridae) transmitted between Culex spp. mosquitoes and avian hosts. The virus has dramatically expanded its geographic range in the past ten years. Increases in global commerce, climate change, ecological factors and the emergence of novel viral genotypes likely play significant roles in the emergence of this virus; however, the exact mechanism and relative importance of each is uncertain. Previously WNV was primarily associated with febrile illness of children in endemic areas, but it was identified as a cause of neurological disease in humans in 1994. This modulation in disease presentation could be the result of the emergence of a more virulent genotype as well as the progression of the virus into areas in which the age structure of immunologically na\"{\i}ve individuals makes them more susceptible to severe neurological disease. Since its introduction to North America in 1999, a novel WNV genotype has been identified that has been demonstrated to disseminate more rapidly and with greater efficiency at elevated temperatures than the originally introduced strain, indicating the potential importance of temperature as a selective criteria for the emergence of WNV genotypes with increased vectorial capacity. Even prior to the North American introduction, a mutation associated with increased replication in avian hosts, identified to be under adaptive evolutionary pressure, has been identified, indicating that adaptation for increased replication within vertebrate hosts could play a role in increased transmission efficiency. Although stable in its evolutionary structure, WNV has demonstrated the capacity for rapidly adapting to both vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors and will likely continue to exploit novel ecological niches as it adapts to novel transmission foci.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Existing methods for whole-genome comparisons require prior knowledge of related species and provide little automation in the function prediction process. Bacteriophage genomes are an example that cannot be easily analyzed by these methods. This work addresses these shortcomings and aims to provide an automated prediction system of gene function. RESULTS: We have developed a novel system called SynFPS to perform gene function prediction over completed genomes. The prediction system is initialized by clustering a large collection of weakly related genomes into groups based on their resemblance in gene distribution. From each individual group, data are then extracted and used to train a Support Vector Machine that makes gene function predictions. Experiments were conducted with 9 different gene functions over 296 bacteriophage genomes. Cross validation results gave an average prediction accuracy of \~{}80\%, which is comparable to other genomic-context based prediction methods. Functional predictions are also made on 3 uncharacterized genes and 12 genes that cannot be identified by sequence alignment. The software is publicly available at http://www.synteny.net/. CONCLUSION: The proposed system employs genomic context to predict gene function and detect gene correspondence in whole-genome comparisons. Although our experimental focus is on bacteriophages, the method may be extended to other microbial genomes as they share a number of similar characteristics with phage genomes such as gene order conservation.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The availability of the whole genomic sequences of HIV-1 viruses provides an excellent resource for studying the HIV-1 phylogenies using all the genetic materials. However, such huge volumes of data create computational challenges in both memory consumption and CPU usage. RESULTS: We propose the complete composition vector representation for an HIV-1 strain, and a string scoring method to extract the nucleotide composition strings that contain the richest evolutionary information for phylogenetic analysis. In this way, a large-scale whole genome phylogenetic analysis for thousands of strains can be done both efficiently and effectively. By using 42 carefully curated strains as references, we apply our method to subtype 1156 HIV-1 strains (10.5 million nucleotides in total), which include 825 pure subtype strains and 331 recombinants. Our results show that our nucleotide composition string selection scheme is computationally efficient, and is able to define both pure subtypes and recombinant forms for HIV-1 strains using the 5000 top ranked nucleotide strings.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The availability of the whole genomic sequences of HIV-1 viruses provides an excellent resource for studying the HIV-1 phylogenies using all the genetic materials. However, such huge volumes of data create computational challenges in both memory consumption and CPU usage. RESULTS: We propose the complete composition vector representation for an HIV-1 strain, and a string scoring method to extract the nucleotide composition strings that contain the richest evolutionary information for phylogenetic analysis. In this way, a large-scale whole genome phylogenetic analysis for thousands of strains can be done both efficiently and effectively. By using 42 carefully curated strains as references, we apply our method to subtype 1156 HIV-1 strains (10.5 million nucleotides in total), which include 825 pure subtype strains and 331 recombinants. Our results show that our nucleotide composition string selection scheme is computationally efficient, and is able to define both pure subtypes and recombinant forms for HIV-1 strains using the 5000 top ranked nucleotide strings. AVAILABILITY: The Java executable and the HIV-1 datasets are accessible through 'http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/\~{}ghlin/src/WebTools/hiv.php.

@article{Dennehy2010,
	Abstract = {A pathogen can readily mutate to infect new host types, but this does not guarantee successful establishment in the new habitat. What factors, then, dictate emergence success? One possibility is that the pathogen population cannot sustain itself on the new host type (i.e. host is a sink), but migration from a source population allows adaptive sustainability and eventual emergence by delivering beneficial mutations sampled from the source's standing genetic variation. This idea is relevant regardless of whether the sink host is truly novel (host shift) or whether the sink is an existing or related, similar host population thriving under conditions unfavourable to pathogen persistence (range expansion). We predicted that sink adaptation should occur faster under range expansion than during a host shift owing to the effects of source genetic variation on pathogen adaptability in the sink. Under range expansion, source migration should benefit emergence in the sink because selection acting on source and sink populations is likely to be congruent. By contrast, during host shifts, source migration is likely to disrupt emergence in the sink owing to uncorrelated selection or performance tradeoffs across host types. We tested this hypothesis by evolving bacteriophage populations on novel host bacteria under sink conditions, while manipulating emergence via host shift versus range expansion. Controls examined sink adaptation when unevolved founding genotypes served as migrants. As predicted, adaptability was fastest under range expansion, and controls did not adapt. Large, similar and similarly timed increases in fitness were observed in the host-shift populations, despite declines in mean fitness of immigrants through time. These results suggest that source populations are the origin of mutations that drive adaptive emergence at the edge of a pathogen's ecological or geographical range.},

	Abstract = {Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95\%, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.},

Given the cost and time constraints associated with phenotypic resistance testing, computational approaches leading to accurate predictive models of resistance based on a patient's mutational patterns in the target protein would provide a welcome alternative. A combined sequence-structure computational mutagenesis procedure is used to generate attribute vectors for each of 222 mutational patterns of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase that were isolated and sequenced from patients. Phenotypic fold-levels of resistance to the non-nucleoside inhibitor Nevirapine are known for over 25\% of these mutants, whose values are used to assign each assayed mutant to a drug susceptibility class, either sensitive or resistant. Support vector machine and random forest supervised learning algorithms applied to this subset respectively classify mutants based on drug susceptibility with 85\% and 92\% cross-validation accuracy. The trained models are used to predict susceptibility to Nevirapine for all remaining mutant isolates, and predictions are in agreement for 90\% of the test cases.},

	Abstract = {Most parametric methods for detecting foreign genes in bacterial genomes use a scoring function that measures the atypicality of a gene with respect to the bulk of the genome. Genes whose features are sufficiently atypical-lying beyond a threshold value-are deemed foreign. Yet these methods fail when the range of features of donor genomes overlaps with that of the recipient genome, leading to misclassification of foreign and native genes; existing parametric methods choose threshold parameters to balance these error rates. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a two-pronged approach to minimize the misclassification of genes. First, beyond classifying genes as merely atypical, a gene clustering method based on Jensen-Shannon entropic divergence identifies classes of foreign genes that are also similar to each other. Second, genome position is used to reassign genes among classes whose composition features overlap. This process minimizes the misclassification of either native or foreign genes that are weakly atypical. The performance of this approach was assessed using artificial chimeric genomes and then applied to the well-characterized Escherichia coli K12 genome. Not only were foreign genes identified with a high degree of accuracy, but genes originating from the same donor organism were effectively grouped.},

Infection by high-risk genital HPVs is associated with the development of anogenital cancers. Classification of risk types is important in understanding the mechanisms in infection and in developing novel instruments for medical examination such as DNA microarrays. The sequence-based classification methods are useful in classifying risk types by considering residues in conserved positions. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to the classification of HPV risk types by using the protein sequences. Our approach is based on the hidden Markov model and the kernel method. The former searches informative subsequence positions and the latter computes efficiently to classify protein sequences. In the experiments, the classifier predicted four unknown HPV types exactly. An additional result shows that the kernel-based classifiers learned with more informative subsequences outperform the classifiers learned with the whole sequence or random subsequences.},

	Abstract = {Automated functional annotation of nsSNPs requires that amino-acid residue changes are represented by a set of descriptive features, such as evolutionary conservation, side-chain volume change, effect on ligand-binding, and residue structural rigidity. Identifying the most informative combinations of features is critical to the success of a computational prediction method. We rank 32 features according to their mutual information with functional effects of amino-acid substitutions, as measured by in vivo assays. In addition, we use a greedy algorithm to identify a subset of highly informative features. The method is simple to implement and provides a quantitative measure for selecting the best predictive features given a set of features that a human expert believes to be informative. We demonstrate the usefulness of the selected highly informative features by cross-validated tests of a computational classifier, a support vector machine (SVM). The SVM's classification accuracy is highly correlated with the ranking of the input features by their mutual information. Two features describing the solvent accessibility of "wild-type" and "mutant" amino-acid residues and one evolutionary feature based on superfamily-level multiple alignments produce comparable overall accuracy and 6\% fewer false positives than a 32-feature set that considers physiochemical properties of amino acids, protein electrostatics, amino-acid residue flexibility, and binding interactions.},

Recently, several large-scale studies have shed light on this problem through analysis of gene expression profiles to identify markers correlated with metastasis. Here, we apply a protein-network-based approach that identifies markers not as individual genes but as subnetworks extracted from protein interaction databases. The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors.},

Many important features, which are originally hidden in the long amino acid sequences, can be clearly displayed through their cellular automata images. One of the remarkable merits by doing so is that many image recognition tools can be straightforwardly applied to the target aimed here. High success rates were observed through the self-consistency, jackknife, and independent dataset tests, respectively.},

RESULTS: We have developed a novel system called SynFPS to perform gene function prediction over completed genomes. The prediction system is initialized by clustering a large collection of weakly related genomes into groups based on their resemblance in gene distribution. From each individual group, data are then extracted and used to train a Support Vector Machine that makes gene function predictions. Experiments were conducted with 9 different gene functions over 296 bacteriophage genomes. Cross validation results gave an average prediction accuracy of \~{}80\%, which is comparable to other genomic-context based prediction methods. Functional predictions are also made on 3 uncharacterized genes and 12 genes that cannot be identified by sequence alignment. The software is publicly available at http://www.synteny.net/. CONCLUSION: The proposed system employs genomic context to predict gene function and detect gene correspondence in whole-genome comparisons. Although our experimental focus is on bacteriophages, the method may be extended to other microbial genomes as they share a number of similar characteristics with phage genomes such as gene order conservation.},

	Abstract = {A pathogen can readily mutate to infect new host types, but this does not guarantee successful establishment in the new habitat. What factors, then, dictate emergence success? One possibility is that the pathogen population cannot sustain itself on the new host type (i.e. host is a sink), but migration from a source population allows adaptive sustainability and eventual emergence by delivering beneficial mutations sampled from the source's standing genetic variation. This idea is relevant regardless of whether the sink host is truly novel (host shift) or whether the sink is an existing or related, similar host population thriving under conditions unfavourable to pathogen persistence (range expansion). We predicted that sink adaptation should occur faster under range expansion than during a host shift owing to the effects of source genetic variation on pathogen adaptability in the sink. Under range expansion, source migration should benefit emergence in the sink because selection acting on source and sink populations is likely to be congruent. By contrast, during host shifts, source migration is likely to disrupt emergence in the sink owing to uncorrelated selection or performance tradeoffs across host types. We tested this hypothesis by evolving bacteriophage populations on novel host bacteria under sink conditions, while manipulating emergence via host shift versus range expansion. Controls examined sink adaptation when unevolved founding genotypes served as migrants. As predicted, adaptability was fastest under range expansion, and controls did not adapt. Large, similar and similarly timed increases in fitness were observed in the host-shift populations, despite declines in mean fitness of immigrants through time. These results suggest that source populations are the origin of mutations that drive adaptive emergence at the edge of a pathogen's ecological or geographical range.},

	Abstract = {Splice site prediction on an RNA virus has two potential difficulties seriously degrading the performance of most conventional splice site predictors. One is a limited number of strains available for a virus species and the other is the diversified sequence patterns around the splice sites caused by the high mutation frequency. To overcome these two difficulties, a new algorithm called Genomic Splice Site Prediction (GSSP) algorithm, was proposed for splice site prediction of RNA viruses. The key idea of the GSSP algorithm was to characterize the interdependency among the nucleotides and base positions based on the eigen-patterns. Identified by a sequence pattern mining technique, each eigen-pattern specified a unique composition of the base positions and the nucleotides occurring at the positions. To remedy the problem of insufficient training data due to the limited number of strains for an RNA virus, a cross-species strategy was employed in this study. The GSSP algorithm was shown to be effective and superior to two conventional methods in predicting the splice sites of five RNA species in the Orthomyxoviruses family. The sensitivity and specificity achieved by the GSSP algorithm was higher than 99 and 94\%, respectively, for the donor sites, and was higher than 96 and 92\%, respectively, for the acceptor sites.

	Abstract = {Serum is frequently added to the defined basal medium as a source of certain nutritional and macromolecular growth factors essential for cell growth. Although a number of synthetic media have been prepared serum continuesto be used in cell culture by many investigators. The best supplementation to a basal medium is fetal bovine serum (FBS) that is most frequently used for all types of cell cultures. During last four decades National Institute of Virology, Pune, has been working on isolation and identification of viruses from clinical specimens, employing tissue culture. Initially FBS was used for this purpose. However, due to its prohibitive cost and uncertain supply an alternative was sought. Commercially available sera from newborn calf, sheep, horse, human and serum obtained from goat blood (available from local abattoir) were tried. Goat serum (GS) was found to be suitable for most of the cell lines and primary cultures. Primary cultures from guinea pig embryo, monkey kidney, chick embryo, mouse peritoneal macrophages, and established cell lines were prepared and grown in growth media supplemented with GS. These cultures were studied for their morphology and growth in comparison with cultures grown in FBS containing media, and were used for mass cultivation of cells, quantitation and susceptibility of various virus strains, studies on effects of different nutrients and natural substances on cellular metabolism and virus replication, epitope analysis of various strains of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, strain differentiation studies, studies on antibody dependent plaque enhancement, assay of murine migration inhibition factor. Monoclonal antibodies against JE virus adapted to GS were characterised for their retention of functionalities. The results were comparable to those of cell cultures grown in FBS containing media. Similar results on chromosome studies were obtained from patient's whole blood cultures prepared in GS and FBS containing growth media. Organ cultures from mammalian, reptile and avian hosts; successfully grown in GS supplemented growth media, were used for different virological studies. Growth media supplemented with GS were used for in vitro cultivation of malarial parasites. Thus since the last three decades many scientists are using GS in place of FBS, in various fields of biomedical research. The present article reviews an account of the same.},

We question whether homeostasis alone adequately explains microbial responses to environmental stimuli, and explore the capacity of intracellular networks for predictive behavior in a fashion similar to metazoan nervous systems. We show that in silico biochemical networks, evolving randomly under precisely defined complex habitats, capture the dynamical, multidimensional structure of diverse environments by forming internal representations that allow prediction of environmental change. We provide evidence for such anticipatory behavior by revealing striking correlations of Escherichia coli transcriptional responses to temperature and oxygen perturbations-precisely mirroring the covariation of these parameters upon transitions between the outside world and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. We further show that these internal correlations reflect a true associative learning paradigm, because they show rapid decoupling upon exposure to novel environments.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The amount of data on protein-protein interactions (PPIs) available in public databases and in the literature has rapidly expanded in recent years. PPI data can provide useful information for researchers in pharmacology and medicine as well as those in interactome studies. There is urgent need for a novel methodology or software allowing the efficient utilization of PPI data in pharmacology and medicine. RESULTS: To address this need, we have developed the 'Druggable Protein-protein Interaction Assessment System' (Dr. PIAS). Dr. PIAS has a meta-database that stores various types of information (tertiary structures, drugs/chemicals, and biological functions associated with PPIs) retrieved from public sources. By integrating this information, Dr. PIAS assesses whether a PPI is druggable as a target for small chemical ligands by using a supervised machine-learning method, support vector machine (SVM). Dr. PIAS holds not only known druggable PPIs but also all PPIs of human, mouse, rat, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) proteins identified to date. CONCLUSIONS: The design concept of Dr. PIAS is distinct from other published PPI databases in that it focuses on selecting the PPIs most likely to make good drug targets, rather than merely collecting PPI data.},

Based on ongoing research, and designed to use the project-based-learning approach, the modules highlight applications of modern discrete mathematics and algebraic statistics to pressing problems in molecular biology. For the majority of projects, calculus is not a required prerequisite and, due to the modest amount of mathematical background needed for some of the modules, the materials can be used for an early introduction to mathematical modeling. At the same time, most modules are connected with topics in linear and abstract algebra, algebraic geometry, and probability, and they can be used as meaningful applied introductions into the relevant advanced-level mathematics courses. Open-source software is used to facilitate the relevant computations. As a detailed example, we outline a module that focuses on Boolean models of the lac operon network.},

Herein, functional assignment of complete YFV proteome was done through support vector machine. Major envelope (E) protein that mediates entry of YFV into host cell was selected as a potent molecular target. Three dimensional structure of the molecular target was predicted using Modeller9v7. The model was optimized in Maestro9.0 applying OPLS AA force field and was evaluated using PROCHECK, ProSA, ProQ and Profile 3D. The BOG pocket residues Val48, Glu197, Thr200, Ile204, Thr265, Thr268 and Gly278 were located in YFV E protein using SiteMap2.3. More than one million compounds of Ligandinfo Meta database were explored using a computational virtual screening protocol targeting BOG pocket of the E protein. Finally, ten top ranked lead molecules with strong binding affinity to BOG pocket of YFV E protein were identified based on XP Gscore. Drug likeliness and comparative bioactivity analysis for these leads using QikProp3.2 had shown that these molecules would have the potential to act as better drug. Thus, the 10 lead molecules suggested in the present study would be of interest as promising starting point for designing antiviral compound against yellow fever.},

Within the theoretical models Boolean networks occupy an increasing role as they are eminently suited at mapping biological observations and hypotheses into a mathematical formalism. The conceptual underpinnings of Boolean modeling are very accessible even without a background in quantitative sciences, yet it allows life scientists to describe and explore a wide range of surprisingly complex phenomena. In this paper we provide a clear overview of the concepts used in Boolean simulations, present a software library that can perform these simulations based on simple text inputs and give three case studies. The large scale simulations in these case studies demonstrate the Boolean paradigms and their applicability as well as the advanced features and complex use cases that our software package allows. Our software is distributed via a liberal Open Source license and is freely accessible from http://booleannet.googlecode.com.},

	Abstract = {The Gene Ontology (GO) is extensively used to analyze all types of high-throughput experiments. However, researchers still face several challenges when using GO and other functional annotation databases. One problem is the large number of multiple hypotheses that are being tested for each study. In addition, categories often overlap with both direct parents/descendents and other distant categories in the hierarchical structure. This makes it hard to determine if the identified significant categories represent different functional outcomes or rather a redundant view of the same biological processes. To overcome these problems we developed a generative probabilistic model which identifies a (small) subset of categories that, together, explain the selected gene set. Our model accommodates noise and errors in the selected gene set and GO. Using controlled GO data our method correctly recovered most of the selected categories, leading to dramatic improvements over current methods for GO analysis. When used with microarray expression data and ChIP-chip data from yeast and human our method was able to correctly identify both general and specific enriched categories which were overlooked by other methods.},

	Abstract = {Plasmid vectors containing Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes were constructed that expressed prM and E proteins under the control of a cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter. COS-1 cells transformed with this plasmid vector (JE-4B clone) secreted JEV-specific extracellular particles (EPs) into the culture media. Groups of outbred ICR mice were given one or two doses of recombinant plasmid DNA or two doses of the commercial vaccine JEVAX. All mice that received one or two doses of DNA vaccine maintained JEV-specific antibodies 18 months after initial immunization. JEVAX induced 100\% seroconversion in 3-week-old mice; however, none of the 3-day-old mice had enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers higher than 1:400. Female mice immunized with this DNA vaccine developed plaque reduction neutralization antibody titers of between 1:20 and 1:160 and provided 45 to 100\% passive protection to their progeny following intraperitoneal challenge with 5,000 PFU of virulent JEV strain SA14. Seven-week-old adult mice that had received a single dose of JEV DNA vaccine when 3 days of age were completely protected from a 50,000-PFU JEV intraperitoneal challenge. These results demonstrate that a recombinant plasmid DNA which produced JEV EPs in vitro is an effective vaccine.},

	Abstract = {Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small DNA tumor viruses which infect epithelial tissues and induce hyperproliferative lesions. Infection by high-risk genital HPVs is associated with the development of anogenital cancers. Classification of risk types is important in understanding the mechanisms in infection and in developing novel instruments for medical examination such as DNA microarrays. The sequence-based classification methods are useful in classifying risk types by considering residues in conserved positions. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to the classification of HPV risk types by using the protein sequences. Our approach is based on the hidden Markov model and the kernel method. The former searches informative subsequence positions and the latter computes efficiently to classify protein sequences. In the experiments, the classifier predicted four unknown HPV types exactly. An additional result shows that the kernel-based classifiers learned with more informative subsequences outperform the classifiers learned with the whole sequence or random subsequences.},

	Abstract = {Serum is frequently added to the defined basal medium as a source of certain nutritional and macromolecular growth factors essential for cell growth. Although a number of synthetic media have been prepared serum continuesto be used in cell culture by many investigators. The best supplementation to a basal medium is fetal bovine serum (FBS) that is most frequently used for all types of cell cultures. During last four decades National Institute of Virology, Pune, has been working on isolation and identification of viruses from clinical specimens, employing tissue culture. Initially FBS was used for this purpose. However, due to its prohibitive cost and uncertain supply an alternative was sought. Commercially available sera from newborn calf, sheep, horse, human and serum obtained from goat blood (available from local abattoir) were tried. Goat serum (GS) was found to be suitable for most of the cell lines and primary cultures. Primary cultures from guinea pig embryo, monkey kidney, chick embryo, mouse peritoneal macrophages, and established cell lines were prepared and grown in growth media supplemented with GS. These cultures were studied for their morphology and growth in comparison with cultures grown in FBS containing media, and were used for mass cultivation of cells, quantitation and susceptibility of various virus strains, studies on effects of different nutrients and natural substances on cellular metabolism and virus replication, epitope analysis of various strains of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, strain differentiation studies, studies on antibody dependent plaque enhancement, assay of murine migration inhibition factor. Monoclonal antibodies against JE virus adapted to GS were characterised for their retention of functionalities. The results were comparable to those of cell cultures grown in FBS containing media. Similar results on chromosome studies were obtained from patient's whole blood cultures prepared in GS and FBS containing growth media. Organ cultures from mammalian, reptile and avian hosts; successfully grown in GS supplemented growth media, were used for different virological studies. Growth media supplemented with GS were used for in vitro cultivation of malarial parasites. Thus since the last three decades many scientists are using GS in place of FBS, in various fields of biomedical research. The present article reviews an account of the same.},

It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},

Recently, several large-scale studies have shed light on this problem through analysis of gene expression profiles to identify markers correlated with metastasis. Here, we apply a protein-network-based approach that identifies markers not as individual genes but as subnetworks extracted from protein interaction databases. The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors.},

	Abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},

	Abstract = {The homeostatic framework has dominated our understanding of cellular physiology. We question whether homeostasis alone adequately explains microbial responses to environmental stimuli, and explore the capacity of intracellular networks for predictive behavior in a fashion similar to metazoan nervous systems. We show that in silico biochemical networks, evolving randomly under precisely defined complex habitats, capture the dynamical, multidimensional structure of diverse environments by forming internal representations that allow prediction of environmental change. We provide evidence for such anticipatory behavior by revealing striking correlations of Escherichia coli transcriptional responses to temperature and oxygen perturbations-precisely mirroring the covariation of these parameters upon transitions between the outside world and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. We further show that these internal correlations reflect a true associative learning paradigm, because they show rapid decoupling upon exposure to novel environments.},

@article{Tsirigos2005,
	Abstract = {In earlier work, we introduced and discussed a generalized computational framework for identifying horizontal transfers. This framework relied on a gene's nucleotide composition, obviated the need for knowledge of codon boundaries and database searches, and was shown to perform very well across a wide range of archaeal and bacterial genomes when compared with previously published approaches, such as Codon Adaptation Index and C + G content. Nonetheless, two considerations remained outstanding: we wanted to further increase the sensitivity of detecting horizontal transfers and also to be able to apply the method to increasingly smaller genomes. In the discussion that follows, we present such a method, Wn-SVM, and show that it exhibits a very significant improvement in sensitivity compared with earlier approaches. Wn-SVM uses a one-class support-vector machine and can learn using rather small training sets. This property makes Wn-SVM particularly suitable for studying small-size genomes, similar to those of viruses, as well as the typically larger archaeal and bacterial genomes. We show experimentally that the new method results in a superior performance across a wide range of organisms and that it improves even upon our own earlier method by an average of 10\% across all examined genomes. As a small-genome case study, we analyze the genome of the human cytomegalovirus and demonstrate that Wn-SVM correctly identifies regions that are known to be conserved and prototypical of all beta-herpesvirinae, regions that are known to have been acquired horizontally from the human host and, finally, regions that had not up to now been suspected to be horizontally transferred. Atypical region predictions for many eukaryotic viruses, including the alpha-, beta- and gamma-herpesvirinae, and 123 archaeal and bacterial genomes, have been made available online at http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/HGT\_SVM/.},

	Abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tropism can be assessed using phenotypic assays, but this is quite laborious, expensive, and time-consuming and can be made only in sophisticated laboratories. More accessible albeit reliable tools for testing of HIV-1 tropism are needed in view of the prompt introduction of CCR5 antagonists in clinical practice. Bioinformatics tools based on V3 sequences might help to predict HIV-1 tropism; however, most of these methods have been designed by taking only genetic information derived from HIV-1 subtype B into consideration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of several genotypic tools to predict HIV-1 tropism in non-B subtypes, as data on this issue are scarce. Plasma samples were tested using a new phenotypic tropism assay (Phenoscript-tropism; Eurofins), and results were compared with estimates of coreceptor usage using eight different genotypic predictor softwares (Support Vector Machine [SVM], C4.5, C4.5 with positions 8 to 12 only, PART, Charge Rule, geno2pheno coreceptor, Position-Specific Scoring Matrix X4R5 [PSSM(X4R5)], and PSSM(sinsi)). A total of 150 samples were tested, with 115 belonging to patients infected with non-B subtypes and 35 drawn from subtype B-infected patients, which were taken as controls. When non-B subtypes were tested, the concordances between the results obtained using the phenotypic assay and distinct genotypic tools were as follows: 78.8\% for SVM, 77.5\% for C4.5, 82.5\% for C4.5 with positions 8 to 12 only, 82.5\% for PART, 82.5\% for Charge Rule, 82.5\% for PSSM(X4R5), 83.8\% for PSSM(sinsi), and 71.3\% for geno2pheno. When clade B viruses were tested, the best concordances were seen for PSSM(X4R5) (91.4\%), PSSM(sinsi) (88.6\%), and geno2pheno (88.6\%). The sensitivity for detecting X4 variants was lower for non-B than for B viruses, especially in the case of PSSM(sinsi) (38.4\% versus 100\%, respectively), SVM(wetcat) (46\% versus 100\%, respectively), and PART (30\% versus 90\%, respectively). In summary, while inferences of HIV-1 coreceptor usage using genotypic tools seem to be reliable for clade B viruses, their performances are poor for non-B subtypes, in which they particularly fail to detect X4 variants.},

	Abstract = {Splice site prediction on an RNA virus has two potential difficulties seriously degrading the performance of most conventional splice site predictors. One is a limited number of strains available for a virus species and the other is the diversified sequence patterns around the splice sites caused by the high mutation frequency. To overcome these two difficulties, a new algorithm called Genomic Splice Site Prediction (GSSP) algorithm, was proposed for splice site prediction of RNA viruses. The key idea of the GSSP algorithm was to characterize the interdependency among the nucleotides and base positions based on the eigen-patterns. Identified by a sequence pattern mining technique, each eigen-pattern specified a unique composition of the base positions and the nucleotides occurring at the positions. To remedy the problem of insufficient training data due to the limited number of strains for an RNA virus, a cross-species strategy was employed in this study. The GSSP algorithm was shown to be effective and superior to two conventional methods in predicting the splice sites of five RNA species in the Orthomyxoviruses family. The sensitivity and specificity achieved by the GSSP algorithm was higher than 99 and 94\%, respectively, for the donor sites, and was higher than 96 and 92\%, respectively, for the acceptor sites.

Despite the well-described epidemiological patterns of WNV in North America, the basis for the emergence of WNV-associated avian pathology, particularly in the American crow (AMCR) sentinel species, and the large scale of the North American epidemic and epiornitic is uncertain. We report here that the introduction of a T249P amino acid substitution in the NS3 helicase (found in North American WNV) in a low-virulence strain was sufficient to generate a phenotype highly virulent to AMCRs. Furthermore, comparative sequence analyses of full-length WNV genomes demonstrated that the same site (NS3-249) was subject to adaptive evolution. These phenotypic and evolutionary results provide compelling evidence for the positive selection of a mutation encoding increased viremia potential and virulence in the AMCR sentinel bird species.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The availability of the whole genomic sequences of HIV-1 viruses provides an excellent resource for studying the HIV-1 phylogenies using all the genetic materials. However, such huge volumes of data create computational challenges in both memory consumption and CPU usage. RESULTS: We propose the complete composition vector representation for an HIV-1 strain, and a string scoring method to extract the nucleotide composition strings that contain the richest evolutionary information for phylogenetic analysis. In this way, a large-scale whole genome phylogenetic analysis for thousands of strains can be done both efficiently and effectively. By using 42 carefully curated strains as references, we apply our method to subtype 1156 HIV-1 strains (10.5 million nucleotides in total), which include 825 pure subtype strains and 331 recombinants. Our results show that our nucleotide composition string selection scheme is computationally efficient, and is able to define both pure subtypes and recombinant forms for HIV-1 strains using the 5000 top ranked nucleotide strings.

@article{Kim2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced Text Mining (TM) such as semantic enrichment of papers, event or relation extraction, and intelligent Question Answering have increasingly attracted attention in the bio-medical domain. For such attempts to succeed, text annotation from the biological point of view is indispensable. However, due to the complexity of the task, semantic annotation has never been tried on a large scale, apart from relatively simple term annotation. RESULTS: We have completed a new type of semantic annotation, event annotation, which is an addition to the existing annotations in the GENIA corpus. The corpus has already been annotated with POS (Parts of Speech), syntactic trees, terms, etc. The new annotation was made on half of the GENIA corpus, consisting of 1,000 Medline abstracts. It contains 9,372 sentences in which 36,114 events are identified. The major challenges during event annotation were (1) to design a scheme of annotation which meets specific requirements of text annotation, (2) to achieve biology-oriented annotation which reflect biologists' interpretation of text, and (3) to ensure the homogeneity of annotation quality across annotators. To meet these challenges, we introduced new concepts such as Single-facet Annotation and Semantic Typing, which have collectively contributed to successful completion of a large scale annotation. CONCLUSION: The resulting event-annotated corpus is the largest and one of the best in quality among similar annotation efforts. We expect it to become a valuable resource for NLP (Natural Language Processing)-based TM in the bio-medical domain.},

	Abstract = {Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95\%, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.},

For the majority of projects, calculus is not a required prerequisite and, due to the modest amount of mathematical background needed for some of the modules, the materials can be used for an early introduction to mathematical modeling. At the same time, most modules are connected with topics in linear and abstract algebra, algebraic geometry, and probability, and they can be used as meaningful applied introductions into the relevant advanced-level mathematics courses.

The GSSP algorithm was shown to be effective and superior to two conventional methods in predicting the splice sites of five RNA species in the Orthomyxoviruses family. The sensitivity and specificity achieved by the GSSP algorithm was higher than 99 and 94\%, respectively, for the donor sites, and was higher than 96 and 92\%, respectively, for the acceptor sites.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advanced Text Mining (TM) such as semantic enrichment of papers, event or relation extraction, and intelligent Question Answering have increasingly attracted attention in the bio-medical domain. For such attempts to succeed, text annotation from the biological point of view is indispensable. However, due to the complexity of the task, semantic annotation has never been tried on a large scale, apart from relatively simple term annotation. RESULTS: We have completed a new type of semantic annotation, event annotation, which is an addition to the existing annotations in the GENIA corpus. The corpus has already been annotated with POS (Parts of Speech), syntactic trees, terms, etc. The new annotation was made on half of the GENIA corpus, consisting of 1,000 Medline abstracts. It contains 9,372 sentences in which 36,114 events are identified. The major challenges during event annotation were (1) to design a scheme of annotation which meets specific requirements of text annotation, (2) to achieve biology-oriented annotation which reflect biologists' interpretation of text, and (3) to ensure the homogeneity of annotation quality across annotators. To meet these challenges, we introduced new concepts such as Single-facet Annotation and Semantic Typing, which have collectively contributed to successful completion of a large scale annotation. CONCLUSION: The resulting event-annotated corpus is the largest and one of the best in quality among similar annotation efforts. We expect it to become a valuable resource for NLP (Natural Language Processing)-based TM in the bio-medical domain.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The availability of the whole genomic sequences of HIV-1 viruses provides an excellent resource for studying the HIV-1 phylogenies using all the genetic materials. However, such huge volumes of data create computational challenges in both memory consumption and CPU usage. RESULTS: We propose the complete composition vector representation for an HIV-1 strain, and a string scoring method to extract the nucleotide composition strings that contain the richest evolutionary information for phylogenetic analysis. In this way, a large-scale whole genome phylogenetic analysis for thousands of strains can be done both efficiently and effectively. By using 42 carefully curated strains as references, we apply our method to subtype 1156 HIV-1 strains (10.5 million nucleotides in total), which include 825 pure subtype strains and 331 recombinants. Our results show that our nucleotide composition string selection scheme is computationally efficient, and is able to define both pure subtypes and recombinant forms for HIV-1 strains using the 5000 top ranked nucleotide strings.

@article{Tsirigos2005,
	Abstract = {In earlier work, we introduced and discussed a generalized computational framework for identifying horizontal transfers. This framework relied on a gene's nucleotide composition, obviated the need for knowledge of codon boundaries and database searches, and was shown to perform very well across a wide range of archaeal and bacterial genomes when compared with previously published approaches, such as Codon Adaptation Index and C + G content. Nonetheless, two considerations remained outstanding: we wanted to further increase the sensitivity of detecting horizontal transfers and also to be able to apply the method to increasingly smaller genomes. In the discussion that follows, we present such a method, Wn-SVM, and show that it exhibits a very significant improvement in sensitivity compared with earlier approaches. Wn-SVM uses a one-class support-vector machine and can learn using rather small training sets. This property makes Wn-SVM particularly suitable for studying small-size genomes, similar to those of viruses, as well as the typically larger archaeal and bacterial genomes. We show experimentally that the new method results in a superior performance across a wide range of organisms and that it improves even upon our own earlier method by an average of 10\% across all examined genomes. As a small-genome case study, we analyze the genome of the human cytomegalovirus and demonstrate that Wn-SVM correctly identifies regions that are known to be conserved and prototypical of all beta-herpesvirinae, regions that are known to have been acquired horizontally from the human host and, finally, regions that had not up to now been suspected to be horizontally transferred. Atypical region predictions for many eukaryotic viruses, including the alpha-, beta- and gamma-herpesvirinae, and 123 archaeal and bacterial genomes, have been made available online at http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/HGT\_SVM/.},

This book provides a detailed overview of current research in kernel methods and their applications to computational biology.Following three introductory chapters---an introduction to molecular and computational biology, a short review of kernel methods that focuses on intuitive concepts rather than technical details, and a detailed survey of recent applications of kernel methods in computational biology---the book is divided into three sections that reflect three general trends in current research. The first part presents different ideas for the design of kernel functions specifically adapted to various biological data; the second part covers different approaches to learning from heterogeneous data; and the third part offers examples of successful applications of support vector machine methods.},

@article{Azad2007,
	Abstract = {Most parametric methods for detecting foreign genes in bacterial genomes use a scoring function that measures the atypicality of a gene with respect to the bulk of the genome. Genes whose features are sufficiently atypical-lying beyond a threshold value-are deemed foreign. Yet these methods fail when the range of features of donor genomes overlaps with that of the recipient genome, leading to misclassification of foreign and native genes; existing parametric methods choose threshold parameters to balance these error rates. To circumvent this problem, we have developed a two-pronged approach to minimize the misclassification of genes. First, beyond classifying genes as merely atypical, a gene clustering method based on Jensen-Shannon entropic divergence identifies classes of foreign genes that are also similar to each other. Second, genome position is used to reassign genes among classes whose composition features overlap. This process minimizes the misclassification of either native or foreign genes that are weakly atypical. The performance of this approach was assessed using artificial chimeric genomes and then applied to the well-characterized Escherichia coli K12 genome. Not only were foreign genes identified with a high degree of accuracy, but genes originating from the same donor organism were effectively grouped.},

	Abstract = {The avalanche of newly found protein sequences in the post-genomic era has motivated and challenged us to develop an automated method that can rapidly and accurately predict the localization of an uncharacterized protein in cells because the knowledge thus obtained can greatly speed up the process in finding its biological functions. However, it is very difficult to establish such a desired predictor by acquiring the key statistical information buried in a pile of extremely complicated and highly variable sequences. In this paper, based on the concept of the pseudo amino acid composition (Chou, K. C. PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Genetics, 2001, 43: 246-255), the approach of cellular automata image is introduced to cope with this problem. Many important features, which are originally hidden in the long amino acid sequences, can be clearly displayed through their cellular automata images. One of the remarkable merits by doing so is that many image recognition tools can be straightforwardly applied to the target aimed here. High success rates were observed through the self-consistency, jackknife, and independent dataset tests, respectively.},

To overcome the lack of labeled data problem, we observe that because some of the organisms may be related to each other, there may be some commonalities across different organisms that can be discovered and used to help boost the data in each localization task in a multi-task learning framework across different organisms. We adapt and compare two specializations of the multi-task learning algorithms on 20 different organisms. Our experimental results show that multi-task learning performs much better than the traditional single-task methods. Among the different multi-task learning methods, we found that the multitask kernels and super-type kernels under multi-task learning that share parameters perform slightly better than multi-task learning by sharing latent features. The most significant improvement in terms of localization accuracy is about 25\%.},

However, researchers still face several challenges when using GO and other functional annotation databases. One problem is the large number of multiple hypotheses that are being tested for each study. In addition, categories often overlap with both direct parents/descendents and other distant categories in the hierarchical structure. This makes it hard to determine if the identified significant categories represent different functional outcomes or rather a redundant view of the same biological processes. To overcome these problems we developed a generative probabilistic model which identifies a (small) subset of categories that, together, explain the selected gene set. Our model accommodates noise and errors in the selected gene set and GO. Using controlled GO data our method correctly recovered most of the selected categories, leading to dramatic improvements over current methods for GO analysis. When used with microarray expression data and ChIP-chip data from yeast and human our method was able to correctly identify both general and specific enriched categories which were overlooked by other methods.},

Despite the well-described epidemiological patterns of WNV in North America, the basis for the emergence of WNV-associated avian pathology, particularly in the American crow (AMCR) sentinel species, and the large scale of the North American epidemic and epiornitic is uncertain. We report here that the introduction of a T249P amino acid substitution in the NS3 helicase (found in North American WNV) in a low-virulence strain was sufficient to generate a phenotype highly virulent to AMCRs. Furthermore, comparative sequence analyses of full-length WNV genomes demonstrated that the same site (NS3-249) was subject to adaptive evolution. These phenotypic and evolutionary results provide compelling evidence for the positive selection of a mutation encoding increased viremia potential and virulence in the AMCR sentinel bird species.},

	Abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tropism can be assessed using phenotypic assays, but this is quite laborious, expensive, and time-consuming and can be made only in sophisticated laboratories. More accessible albeit reliable tools for testing of HIV-1 tropism are needed in view of the prompt introduction of CCR5 antagonists in clinical practice. Bioinformatics tools based on V3 sequences might help to predict HIV-1 tropism; however, most of these methods have been designed by taking only genetic information derived from HIV-1 subtype B into consideration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of several genotypic tools to predict HIV-1 tropism in non-B subtypes, as data on this issue are scarce. Plasma samples were tested using a new phenotypic tropism assay (Phenoscript-tropism; Eurofins), and results were compared with estimates of coreceptor usage using eight different genotypic predictor softwares (Support Vector Machine [SVM], C4.5, C4.5 with positions 8 to 12 only, PART, Charge Rule, geno2pheno coreceptor, Position-Specific Scoring Matrix X4R5 [PSSM(X4R5)], and PSSM(sinsi)). A total of 150 samples were tested, with 115 belonging to patients infected with non-B subtypes and 35 drawn from subtype B-infected patients, which were taken as controls. When non-B subtypes were tested, the concordances between the results obtained using the phenotypic assay and distinct genotypic tools were as follows: 78.8\% for SVM, 77.5\% for C4.5, 82.5\% for C4.5 with positions 8 to 12 only, 82.5\% for PART, 82.5\% for Charge Rule, 82.5\% for PSSM(X4R5), 83.8\% for PSSM(sinsi), and 71.3\% for geno2pheno. When clade B viruses were tested, the best concordances were seen for PSSM(X4R5) (91.4\%), PSSM(sinsi) (88.6\%), and geno2pheno (88.6\%). The sensitivity for detecting X4 variants was lower for non-B than for B viruses, especially in the case of PSSM(sinsi) (38.4\% versus 100\%, respectively), SVM(wetcat) (46\% versus 100\%, respectively), and PART (30\% versus 90\%, respectively). In summary, while inferences of HIV-1 coreceptor usage using genotypic tools seem to be reliable for clade B viruses, their performances are poor for non-B subtypes, in which they particularly fail to detect X4 variants.},

@article{Tsirigos2005a,
	Abstract = {In earlier work, we introduced and discussed a generalized computational framework for identifying horizontal transfers. This framework relied on a gene's nucleotide composition, obviated the need for knowledge of codon boundaries and database searches, and was shown to perform very well across a wide range of archaeal and bacterial genomes when compared with previously published approaches, such as Codon Adaptation Index and C + G content. Nonetheless, two considerations remained outstanding: we wanted to further increase the sensitivity of detecting horizontal transfers and also to be able to apply the method to increasingly smaller genomes. In the discussion that follows, we present such a method, Wn-SVM, and show that it exhibits a very significant improvement in sensitivity compared with earlier approaches. Wn-SVM uses a one-class support-vector machine and can learn using rather small training sets. This property makes Wn-SVM particularly suitable for studying small-size genomes, similar to those of viruses, as well as the typically larger archaeal and bacterial genomes. We show experimentally that the new method results in a superior performance across a wide range of organisms and that it improves even upon our own earlier method by an average of 10\% across all examined genomes. As a small-genome case study, we analyze the genome of the human cytomegalovirus and demonstrate that Wn-SVM correctly identifies regions that are known to be conserved and prototypical of all beta-herpesvirinae, regions that are known to have been acquired horizontally from the human host and, finally, regions that had not up to now been suspected to be horizontally transferred. Atypical region predictions for many eukaryotic viruses, including the alpha-, beta- and gamma-herpesvirinae, and 123 archaeal and bacterial genomes, have been made available online at http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/HGT\_SVM/.},

	Abstract = {Metagenomics is a discipline that enables the genomic study of uncultured microorganisms. Faster, cheaper sequencing technologies and the ability to sequence uncultured microbes sampled directly from their habitats are expanding and transforming our view of the microbial world. Distilling meaningful information from the millions of new genomic sequences presents a serious challenge to bioinformaticians. In cultured microbes, the genomic data come from a single clone, making sequence assembly and annotation tractable. In metagenomics, the data come from heterogeneous microbial communities, sometimes containing more than 10,000 species, with the sequence data being noisy and partial. From sampling, to assembly, to gene calling and function prediction, bioinformatics faces new demands in interpreting voluminous, noisy, and often partial sequence data. Although metagenomics is a relative newcomer to science, the past few years have seen an explosion in computational methods applied to metagenomic-based research. It is therefore not within the scope of this article to provide an exhaustive review. Rather, we provide here a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the current computational requirements presented by metagenomics, and review the recent progress made. We also note whether there is software that implements any of the methods presented here, and briefly review its utility. Nevertheless, it would be useful if readers of this article would avail themselves of the comment section provided by this journal, and relate their own experiences. Finally, the last section of this article provides a few representative studies illustrating different facets of recent scientific discoveries made using metagenomics.},

Detection of high-risk HPV is important for understanding its oncogenic mechanisms and for developing novel clinical tools for its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Several methods are available to predict the risk types for HPV protein sequences. Nevertheless, no tools can achieve a universally good performance for all domains, including HPV and nor do they provide confidence levels for their decisions. Here, we describe ensembled support vector machines (SVMs) to classify HPV risk types, which assign given proteins into high-, possibly high-, or low-risk type based on their confidence level. Our approach uses protein secondary structures to obtain the differential contribution of subsequences for the risk type, and SVM classifiers are combined with a simple but efficient string kernel to handle HPV protein sequences. In the experiments, we compare our approach with previous methods in accuracy and F1-score, and present the predictions for unknown HPV types, which provides promising results.},

	Abstract = {Automated functional annotation of nsSNPs requires that amino-acid residue changes are represented by a set of descriptive features, such as evolutionary conservation, side-chain volume change, effect on ligand-binding, and residue structural rigidity. Identifying the most informative combinations of features is critical to the success of a computational prediction method. We rank 32 features according to their mutual information with functional effects of amino-acid substitutions, as measured by in vivo assays. In addition, we use a greedy algorithm to identify a subset of highly informative features. The method is simple to implement and provides a quantitative measure for selecting the best predictive features given a set of features that a human expert believes to be informative. We demonstrate the usefulness of the selected highly informative features by cross-validated tests of a computational classifier, a support vector machine (SVM). The SVM's classification accuracy is highly correlated with the ranking of the input features by their mutual information. Two features describing the solvent accessibility of "wild-type" and "mutant" amino-acid residues and one evolutionary feature based on superfamily-level multiple alignments produce comparable overall accuracy and 6\% fewer false positives than a 32-feature set that considers physiochemical properties of amino acids, protein electrostatics, amino-acid residue flexibility, and binding interactions.},

When tested by cross-validation with laboratory measurements, these models predict viral phenotype, or resistance, in response to Reverse-Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTIs) more accurately than other known models. The l1 norm is the most selective convex function, which sets a large proportion of the parameters to zero and also assures that a single optimal solution will be found, given a particular model formulation and training data set. A statistical model that reliably predicts viral drug response is an important tool in the selection of Anti-Retroviral Therapy.

	Abstract = {Splice site prediction on an RNA virus has two potential difficulties seriously degrading the performance of most conventional splice site predictors. One is a limited number of strains available for a virus species and the other is the diversified sequence patterns around the splice sites caused by the high mutation frequency. To overcome these two difficulties, a new algorithm called Genomic Splice Site Prediction (GSSP) algorithm, was proposed for splice site prediction of RNA viruses. The key idea of the GSSP algorithm was to characterize the interdependency among the nucleotides and base positions based on the eigen-patterns. Identified by a sequence pattern mining technique, each eigen-pattern specified a unique composition of the base positions and the nucleotides occurring at the positions. To remedy the problem of insufficient training data due to the limited number of strains for an RNA virus, a cross-species strategy was employed in this study. The GSSP algorithm was shown to be effective and superior to two conventional methods in predicting the splice sites of five RNA species in the Orthomyxoviruses family. The sensitivity and specificity achieved by the GSSP algorithm was higher than 99 and 94\%, respectively, for the donor sites, and was higher than 96 and 92\%, respectively, for the acceptor sites.

We adapt and compare two specializations of the multi-task learning algorithms on 20 different organisms. Our experimental results show that multi-task learning performs much better than the traditional single-task methods. Among the different multi-task learning methods, we found that the multitask kernels and super-type kernels under multi-task learning that share parameters perform slightly better than multi-task learning by sharing latent features.

	Abstract = {Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias. It does this by learning tasks in parallel while using a shared representation; what is learned for each task can help other tasks be learned better. This paper reviews prior work on MTL, presents new evidence that MTL in backprop nets discovers task relatedness without the need of supervisory signals, and presents new results for MTL with k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression. In this paper we demonstrate multitask learning in three domains. We explain how multitask learning works, and show that there are many opportunities for multitask learning in real domains. We present an algorithm and results for multitask learning with case-based methods like k-nearest neighbor and kernel regression, and sketch an algorithm for multitask learning in decision trees. Because multitask learning works, can be applied to many different kinds of domains, and can be used with different learning algorithms, we conjecture there will be many opportunities for its use on real-world problems.},

	Abstract = {Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on our planet. Interactions between viruses and their hosts impact several important biological processes in the world's oceans such as horizontal gene transfer, microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycling. Interrogation of microbial metagenomic sequence data collected as part of the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Expedition (GOS) revealed a high abundance of viral sequences, representing approximately 3\% of the total predicted proteins. Cluster analyses of the viral sequences revealed hundreds to thousands of viral genes encoding various metabolic and cellular functions. Quantitative analyses of viral genes of host origin performed on the viral fraction of aquatic samples confirmed the viral nature of these sequences and suggested that significant portions of aquatic viral communities behave as reservoirs of such genetic material. Distributional and phylogenetic analyses of these host-derived viral sequences also suggested that viral acquisition of environmentally relevant genes of host origin is a more abundant and widespread phenomenon than previously appreciated. The predominant viral sequences identified within microbial fractions originated from tailed bacteriophages and exhibited varying global distributions according to viral family. Recruitment of GOS viral sequence fragments against 27 complete aquatic viral genomes revealed that only one reference bacteriophage genome was highly abundant and was closely related, but not identical, to the cyanomyovirus P-SSM4. The co-distribution across all sampling sites of P-SSM4-like sequences with the dominant ecotype of its host, Prochlorococcus supports the classification of the viral sequences as P-SSM4-like and suggests that this virus may influence the abundance, distribution and diversity of one of the most dominant components of picophytoplankton in oligotrophic oceans. In summary, the abundance and broad geographical distribution of viral sequences within microbial fractions, the prevalence of genes among viral sequences that encode microbial physiological function and their distinct phylogenetic distribution lend strong support to the notion that viral-mediated gene acquisition is a common and ongoing mechanism for generating microbial diversity in the marine environment.},

Unbiased pyrosequencing of RNA extracts from serum and tissues of outbreak victims enabled identification and detailed phylogenetic characterization within 72 hours of sample receipt. Full genome analyses of LUJV showed it to be unique and branching off the ancestral node of the Old World arenaviruses. The virus G1 glycoprotein sequence was highly diverse and almost equidistant from that of other Old World and New World arenaviruses, consistent with a potential distinctive receptor tropism.

Here, we review many of the methods that have been proposed over the years to analyse compositional asymmetries in DNA sequences. Among these we list GC skews, oligonucleotide skews and wavelets, which among other uses have been extensively employed to delimitate origins and termini of replication in genomes. We also review the use of multivariate methods, such as factorial correspondence analysis, discriminant analysis and analysis of variance, which allow assigning compositional strand asymmetries to the different biological processes shaping sequence composition. Finally, we review methods that have been used to infer substitution matrices and allow understanding the mutational processes underlying strand asymmetry. We focus on replication asymmetries because they have been more thoroughly studied, but the methods may be adapted, and often are, to other problems. Although strand asymmetry has been studied more frequently through compositional skews of nucleotides or oligonucleotides, we recall that, depending on the goal of the analysis, other methods may be more appropriate to answer certain biological questions. We also refer to programs freely available to analyse strand asymmetry.},

@article{Seberg2009,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA barcoding promises to revolutionize the way taxonomists work, facilitating species identification by using small, standardized portions of the genome as substitutes for morphology. The concept has gained considerable momentum in many animal groups, but the higher plant world has been largely recalcitrant to the effort. In plants, efforts are concentrated on various regions of the plastid genome, but no agreement exists as to what kinds of regions are ideal, though most researchers agree that more than one region is necessary. One reason for this discrepancy is differences in the tests that are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed regions. Most tests have been made in a floristic setting, where the genetic distance and therefore the level of variation of the regions between taxa is large, or in a limited set of congeneric species. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present the first in-depth coverage of a large taxonomic group, all 86 known species (except two doubtful ones) of crocus. Even six average-sized barcode regions do not identify all crocus species. This is currently an unrealistic burden in a barcode context. Whereas most proposed regions work well in a floristic context, the majority will--as is the case in crocus--undoubtedly be less efficient in a taxonomic setting. However, a reasonable but less than perfect level of identification may be reached--even in a taxonomic context. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The time is ripe for selecting barcode regions in plants, and for prudent examination of their utility. Thus, there is no reason for the plant community to hold back the barcoding effort by continued search for the Holy Grail. We must acknowledge that an emerging system will be far from perfect, fraught with problems and work best in a floristic setting.},

	Abstract = {It is not a coincidence that DNA barcoding has developed in concert with genomics-based investigations. DNA barcoding (a tool for rapid species identification based on DNA sequences) and genomics (which compares entire genome structure and expression) share an emphasis on largescale genetic data acquisition that offers new answers to questions previously beyond the reach of traditional disciplines. DNA barcodes consist of a standardized short sequence of DNA (400800 bp) that in principle should be easily generated and characterized for all species on the planet (1). A massive on-line digital library of barcodes will serve as a standard to which the DNA barcode sequence of an unidentified sample from the forest, garden, or market can be matched. Similar to genomics, which has accelerated the process of recognizing novel genes and comparing gene function, DNA barcoding will allow users to efficiently recognize known species and speed the discovery of species yet to be found in nature. DNA barcoding aims to use the information of one or a few gene regions to identify all species of life, whereas genomics, the inverse of barcoding, describes in one (e.g., humans) or a few selected species the function and interactions across all genes.},

@article{Neal2003,
	Abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can ample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

@book{Bishop2006,
	Abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

	Abstract = {Many real-world problems encountered in several disciplines deal with the modeling of time-series containing different underlying dynamical regimes, for which probabilistic approaches are very often employed. In this paper we describe several such approaches in the common framework of graphical models. We give a unified overview of models previously introduced in the literature, which is simpler and more comprehensive than previous descriptions and enables us to highlight commonalities and differences among models that were not observed in the past. In addition, we present several new models and inference routines, which are naturally derived within this unified viewpoint.},

@article{VanGael2008,
	Abstract = {The infinite hidden Markov model is a non-parametric extension of the widely used hidden Markov model. Our paper introduces a new inference algorithm for the in nite Hidden Markov model called beam sampling. Beam sampling combines slice sampling, which limits the number of states considered at each time step to a nite number, with dynamic programming, which samples whole state trajectories e ciently. Our algorithm typically outperforms the Gibbs sampler and is more robust. We present applications of iHMM inference using the beam sampler on changepoint detection and text prediction problems.},

@article{Beal2002,
	Abstract = {We show that it is possible to extend hidden Markov models to have a countably infinite number of hidden states. By using the theory of Dirichlet processes we can implicitly integrate out the infinitely many transition parameters, leaving only three hyperparameters which can be learned from data. These three hyperparameters define a hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing a rich set of transition dynamics. The three hyperparameters control the time scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix, and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a finite sequence. In this framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be infinite--consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in English text.},
